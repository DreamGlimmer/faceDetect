# Masic_MoveFace

Dependent libraries: opencv2411 and above, Dlib19.7

Main algorithm steps:

1. Detect key points of the face through the face detection algorithm

2. Generate mosaic mapping on the current frame image of the video

3. Obtain the face envelope according to the position of the key points of the face

4. Generate a mask image from the face envelope

5. Combine the mask image and the mosaic image to generate the final dynamic face mosaic image
